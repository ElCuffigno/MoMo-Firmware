*** WellDone MoMo Firmware ***

The bulk of the code lives in mainboard-firmware.

This code should be compiled using Microchip's XC16 compiler for 16-bit PIC24 devices.
It has been tested on version 1.11 of the compiler.

Makefile creation currently requires loading the project in MPLab-IDE.  We hope to migrate to a better, less shoot-yourself-in-the-foot solution soon.
