# Circuit Board Layout Guidelines
This document specifies rules and best practices for laying out and routing MoMo circuit boards.  It should be followed for all MoMo boards.  Additions to this document will be made as new guidelines are needed or board specifications change.

## Feature Sizes
- All silkscreen label text should be size 32 mils in EAGLE.  This is large enough to be legible but not so large as to make placement too difficult.
- Minimum trace/space is 6 mil.  When possible, route with larger trace/spaces but that only really makes sense if you can route the entire board with larger traces.  Power containing traces should be sized according to power demands but at least 12 mils.
